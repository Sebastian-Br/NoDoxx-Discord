# NoDoxx-Discord

This is a project in the making to help protect Discord-Client users' anonymity by filtering messages that may reveal personal details about them they do not wish to share.
When such information is found, the application suspends and closes the Discord Client.
This is suboptimal, but as long as the address that contains the single representation of the chat message that is not used for display/other purposes, but for storage, is found, there aren't many better options.
